        <p>
          This is a short guide to brewing small batches of beer.  It doesn't take much more work to brew 5 gallon batches, but one gallon brews are good if you want to experiment with perfecting recipes, or if you don't have much space; it's possible to brew a one gallon batch even in a small flat.
         </p> 
         <p>
          A one gallon (4.5 litre) demijohn makes around seven 500 ml bottles of beer, and it takes a few weeks to brew the beer.  Preparation on the day of brewing takes a few hours, then there is then a wait of 2 weeks before it can be bottled, and then another two weeks before it is ready to drink.  The equipment costs around £60 (see <a href="#equipment">equipment</a> list below - you may already own some of the items) with an additional cost of around £5 per batch for ingredients.  
          </p>
          <p>
          The method given here is for extract, brew-in-a-bag beer making, which is good for beginners.
        </p>
        <h4>Basics of brewing</h4>
        <p>
          Malted barley is barley that has been made to germinate and then preserved, creating enzymes that turn starch to sugar.  In all-grain brewing these enzymes are activated by soaking the grains in hot water at precise temperatures for an hour or two – a process known as mashing.  Yeast can then convert the sugars into alcohol, giving off carbon dioxide as a by-product.
        </p>
        <p>
          Extract brewing skips the mashing stage, using pre-processed malt sugar (Dry Malt Extract or DME) as a replacement for the malted barley.  Some speciality grains that don't need to be mashed can be used in extract brewing to make more interesting beers.
        </p>       
        <p>
          Hops are added for their antibacterial properties, and to add bitterness and aroma.

        <h4>Equipment needed to get started</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>1 gallon (4.5 litre) demijohn</li>
          <li>funnel to fit the demijohn (around 18cm)</li>
          <li>hydrometer and small measuring cylinder</li>
          <li>siphon with tap</li>
          <li>bubbler airlock</li>
          <li>bottle capper</li>
          <li>bored cork bung</li>
          <li>food thermometer with probe</li>
          <li>large pipette or baster</li>
          <li>polyester or muslin bag (such as a Vinclasse small straining bag)</li>
          <li>room thermometer</li>
          <li>scales (accurate to a tenth of a gram, but also kitchen scales to measure up to around 600g)</li>

        <h3 class="section-title">Process</h3>
        
        <h4>Decide on a recipe</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Search for extract brewing, (not all-grain) recipes and modify them to suit batch size, and ingredients available</li>
          <li>When you start to design your own recipes, the <a href="http://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/calculator/" target="_blank">recipe calculator</a> at Brewer's Friend is very helpful - input different combinations of Dry Malt Extract, grains and hops to calculate predicted alcohol content, bitterness and colour</li>
          <li>Light Dry Malt Extract is a good choice for all types of beers</li>
          <li>This <a href="http://www.homebrewtalk.com/wiki/index.php/Malts_Chart" target="_blank">grain guide</a> has a table of speciality grains that don't require mashing (suitable for extract brewing)</li>
          <li>Different types of <a href="http://hbd.org/abnormal/reference/The%20Ultimate%20Hop%20Chart.pdf" target="_blank">hops</a> have different bittering strengths (alpha acid or AA) and different aromas</li>
          <li>Boiling hops early in the brew gives more bitterness but less aroma</li>
          <li>Adding hops late gives more aroma but less bitterness</li>
          <li>Beers with sweet tasting cereals might need more hoppy bitterness to balance them</li>
          <li>Brewing sugar adds alcohol without adding malt flavour, so can be useful with higher alcohol beers</li>
          <li>Different yeast strains, water chemistry... designing beer recipes can be as complicated or as simple as you want it to be</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Prepare equipment and measure ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Anything that comes into contact with the beer needs to be sterile, so clean all kitchen surfaces thoroughly</li>
          <li>Hard plastic items can be microwaved, but a bucket of sterilizing solution is needed for bungs, siphon tubes and hydrometers</li>
          <li>Glassware can be cleaned in the dishwasher</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Soak any speciality grains in hot water </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The grains should be held in the brew bag in heated clean drinking water at about 66-70°C for half an hour</li>
          <li>This process is known as steeping</li>
          <li>The grains need to be removed from the brew bag afterwards and discarded, as excess soaking can lead to astringent flavours</li>
          <li>The liquid is now called wort</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="brewpot1.jpg" alt="steeping grains">

        <h4>Boil the wort and add hops to the brew bag</h4>
        <ul>

          <li>Unused hops should be stored in an airtight container in the freezer</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Add the dry malt extract</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Add a quarter of the DME at the start of the boil, and the rest nearer the end</li>
          <li>It needs to be boiled for >15 minutes to sterilize and to dissolve any clumps</li>
          <li>When boiling, the wort gives off a strong malty-caramel smell</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Cool down the pot of wort in a sink filled with water or ice</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Cool the wort as quickly as possible to help prevent the formation of unpleasant tasting sulphide compounds</li>
          <li>Once the wort is no longer boiling it becomes important to ensure that anything that comes into contact with it is sterile</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Pour into the demijohn and top up with cold clean water</h4>
        <ul>

          <li>The water needs to be free of bacteria but cold drinking water from the kitchen tap is usually fine</li>
          <li>Top up to 4 litres – where the demijohn starts to curve inwards at the top</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Take a hydrometer reading to get the original gravity</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Fill the measuring cylinder with wort using a pipette</li>
          <li>Float the hydrometer in the wort, read the number (e.g. 1.050) on the side and make a note of it</li>
          <li>The wort can be returned to the demijohn (if all equipment is sterile)</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="hydrometer1.jpg" alt="hydrometer">

        <h4>Add yeast</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Shake the wort to aerate it before adding the yeast (this is the only time oxygen is good for the wort)</li>
          <li>Temperatures of >40°C kill yeast, so make sure the wort is cool enough</li>
          <li>Some yeast strains need to be rehydrated first (check the instructions on the packet)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Fit blow-off tube first, and then change to airlock bubbler</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Use the siphon pipe and tube fitted into the bung as a blow-off tube</li>
          <li>This allows excess froth caused by fermentation to overflow</li>
          <li>Keep the end of the tube under water to keep bacteria out</li>
          <li>When fermentation calms down after a day or two replace the blow off tube with an airlock bubbler half-filled with water</li>
          <li>The fermenting beer should be kept in a place that has a steady but not-too-warm temperature (usually around 15-24°C, but this varies depending on the type of yeast)</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="demijohn1.jpg" alt="blowoff tube">
        <h4>After two weeks take another hydrometer reading to get the final gravity</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Remember to sterilise all equipment that will come into contact with the beer</li>
          <li>Put the original and final gravity readings into a <a href="http://www.brewersfriend.com/abv-calculator/" target="_blank">calculator</a> to calculate the ABV (alcohol by volume)</li>
          <li>If the reading is too high it may mean that fermentation is incomplete (leave for a few days and test again to check)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Bottle the beer, and add priming sugar</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Siphon into bottles that have been sterilised (or fresh from the dishwasher)</li>
          <li>Priming sugar can be calculated using an <a href="http://www.brewersfriend.com/beer-priming-calculator/" target="_blank">online calculator</a></li>
          <li>Be careful with sugar measurements - too much and the bottles may shatter</li>
          <li>Leave the bottles in a cool, but not cold place</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>After another two weeks it is ready to drink!</h4>
        <ul>

          <li>Pour the beer into a glass slowly, taking care not to disturb the yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle</li>
        </ul>
