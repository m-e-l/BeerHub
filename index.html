        <h1>One Gallon Brew</h1>
        <h2>An introduction to very small scale home brewing</h2>
        <h3 class="section-title">Brewing Beer</h3>
        <p>
          Most homebrewers brew in 5 gallon batches, but this short guide is for anyone who only wants to brew 1 gallon at a time.  Why do brewing on such a small scale?  Limitations of space, wanting to experiment to learn more about different recipes, or not ending up with 40 pints of the same brew.  A one gallon (4.5 litre) demijohn gives seven 500 ml bottles of beer so it's a lot of work for a little beer, but there are countless guides for brewing 5 gallon batches elsewhere.  The method given here is for extract, brew-in-a-bag brewing.
        </p>
        <h4>Basics of brewing</h4>
        <p>
          Malted barley is barley that has been made to germinate, and then preserved.  It contains enzymes that turn starch to sugar which are activated by soaking the grains in hot water at precise temperatures for an hour or two – this is called mashing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hops are added for their antibacterial properties, and to add bitterness and aroma.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yeast can then convert the sugars released into alcohol, giving off carbon dioxide as a by product.
        </p>
        <h4>Extract brewing</h4>
        <p>
          Extract brewing skips the mashing stage.  Dry Malt Extract (DME) is pre-processed malt sugar that replaces the malted barley in the recipe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some speciality grains that don't need to be mashed can be used in extract brewing to make more interesting beers.

        <h3 class="section-title">Equipment</h3>

        <h4>Equipment needed to get started</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>1 gallon demijohn</li>
          <li>funnel to fit the demijohn (around 18cm)</li>
          <li>hydrometer</li>
          <li>small measuring cylinder</li>
          <li>siphon with tap</li>
          <li>bubbler airlock</li>
          <li>bottle capper</li>
          <li>bored cork bung</li>
          <li>food thermometer with probe</li>
          <li>large pipette or baster</li>
          <li>polyester brew bag (such as a Vinclasse small straining bag)</li>
          <li>room thermometer</li>
          <li>scales (accurate to a tenth of a gram, but you'll also need normal kitchen scales to measure up to around 600g)</li>
          <li>a reasonably big cooking pot</li>
          <li>a bucket</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Ingredients and equipment needed for each brew</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>hops (pellet or leaf)</li>
          <li>cereals such as roasted barley, crystal malt</li>
          <li>dry malt extract</li>
          <li>brewing sugar</li>
          <li>brewing yeast</li>
          <li>bottle caps</li>
          <li>500 ml brown beer bottles</li>
          <li>sterilizer such as bruclens</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The total cost of the equipment will come to around £60, and the ingredients should come to around £5 per brew.

      <div class="container">
        <h3 class="section-title">Process</h3>
        
        <h4>Decide on a recipe</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Search for extract brewing, not “all grain,” recipes and modify them to suit batch size, and ingredients available</li>
          <li>When you start to design your own recipes, the recipe calculator at Brewer's Friend is very helpful.  Input different combinations of Dry Malt Extract, grains and hops to calculate predicted alcohol content, bitterness and colour</li>
          <li>Light Dry Malt Extract is a good choice for all types of beers</li>
          <li>The grain guide has a table of speciality grains that don't require mashing (suitable for extract brewing)</li>
          <li>Different types of hops have different bittering strengths (alpha acid or AA) and different aromas</li>
          <li>Boiling hops early in the brew gives more bitterness but less aroma</li>
          <li>Adding hops late gives more aroma but less bitterness</li>
          <li>Beers with sweet tasting cereals might need more hoppy bitterness to balance them</li>
          <li>Different yeast strains, water chemistry... designing beer recipes gets as complicated as you want it to be</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Prepare equipment and measure ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Anything coming into contact with the beer needs to be sterile, so clean all kitchen surfaces thoroughly</li>
          <li>Hard plastic items can be microwaved, but a bucket of sterilizing solution is needed for bungs, siphon tubes and hydrometers.  Glassware can be cleaned in the dishwasher</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steep any speciality grains in hot water </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The grains should be held in the brew bag in hot water at about 66-70°C for half an hour</li>
          <li>Excess soaking (or large quantities of water) can lead to astringent flavours so the grains need to be removed afterwards</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Boil up wort and add hops</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Add to the brew bag</li>
          <li>Unused hops should be stored in an airtight container in the freezer</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Add the dry malt extract</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Add a quarter of the DME at the start of the boil, and the rest nearer the end</li>
          <li>It needs to be boiled for >15 minutes to sterilize and to dissolve any clumps</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Cool down the wort rapidly</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>This is help large proteins settle out</li>
          <li>A sink half-full with water is used here</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Pour into the demijohn and top up with cold water</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Cold water from the kitchen tap is fine</li>
          <li>Top up to 4 litres – where the demijohn starts to curve inwards at the top</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Take a hydrometer reading to get the original gravity</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Fill the measuring cylinder with wort using a pipette</li>
          <li>Float the hydrometer in the wort, read the number on the side and make a note </li>
          <li>The wort can be returned to the demijohn (if all equipment is sterile)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Add yeast</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Shake the wort to aerate it before adding the yeast (this is the only time oxygen is good for the wort)</li>
          <li>Temperatures of >40°C kill yeast, so make sure the wort is cool enough</li>
          <li>Some yeast strains need to be rehydrated first</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Fit blow-off tube first, and then change to airlock bubbler</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Use the siphon pipe and tube fitted into the bung as a blow-off tube</li>
          <li>Keep the end of the tube under water to keep bacteria out</li>
          <li>Replace with airlock bubbler half-filled with water when fermentation calms</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>After two weeks take another hydrometer reading to get the final gravity</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Put the original and final gravity readings into a calculator to get the abv</li>
          <li>If the reading is too high fermentation may be incomplete (leave for a few days and test again to check)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Bottle the beer, and add priming sugar</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Siphon into bottles that have been sterilised or fresh from the dishwasher</li>
          <li>Priming sugar can be calculated using an online calculator </li>
          <li>Be careful with sugar measurements - too much and the bottles can shatter</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>After another two weeks it is ready to drink!</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep in a cool, but not cold place until then</li>
          <li>Pour slowly into a glass, taking care not to disturb the yeast sediment</li>
        </ul>
